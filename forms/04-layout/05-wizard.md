Similar to [tabs](tabs), you may want to use a multistep form wizard to reduce the number of components that are visible at once. These are especially useful if your form has a definite chronological order, in which you want each step to be validated as the user progresses.

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Wizard;

Wizard::make([
    Wizard\Step::make('Order')
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ]),
    Wizard\Step::make('Delivery')
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ]),
    Wizard\Step::make('Billing')
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ]),
])
```

> We have different setup instructions you're looking to add a wizard to an app framework [resource Create page](../../app/resources/creating-records#wizards) or a table [action](../tables/actions#wizards). Following that documentation will ensure that the ability to submit the form is only available on the last step.

Each step has a mandatory label. You may optionally also add a description for extra detail:

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Wizard;

Wizard\Step::make('Order')
    ->description('Review your basket')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ]),
```

## Setting up step icons

Steps may also have an icon, which can be the name of any Blade icon component:

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Wizard;

Wizard\Step::make('Order')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-shopping-bag')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ]),
```

## Rendering a submit button on the last step

You may use the `submitAction()` method to render submit button HTML or a view at the end of the wizard, on the last step. This provides a clearer UX than displaying a submit button below the wizard at all times:

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Wizard;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])->submitAction(view('order-form.submit-button'))

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])->submitAction(new HtmlString('<button type="submit">Submit</button>'))
```

## Setting the default active step

You may use the `startOnStep()` method to load a specific step in the wizard:

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Wizard;

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])->startOnStep(2)
```

## Allowing steps to be skipped

If you'd like to allow free navigation, so all steps are skippable, use the `skippable()` method:

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Wizard;

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])->skippable()
```
