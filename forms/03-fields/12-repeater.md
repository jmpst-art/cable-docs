title: Repeater
---

The repeater component allows you to output a JSON array of repeated form components.

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Cable\Forms\Components\Select;
use Cable\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')->required(),
        Select::make('role')
            ->options([
                'member' => 'Member',
                'administrator' => 'Administrator',
                'owner' => 'Owner',
            ])
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->columns(2)
```

We recommend that you store repeater data with a `JSON` column in your database. Additionally, if you're using Eloquent, make sure that column has an `array` cast.

As evident in the above example, the component schema can be defined within the `schema()` method of the component:

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Cable\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')->required(),
        // ...
    ])
```

If you wish to define a repeater with multiple schema blocks that can be repeated in any order, please use the [builder](builder).

## Setting empty default items

Repeaters may have a certain number of empty items created by default, using the `defaultItems()` method:

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->defaultItems(3)
```

## Setting a create item button label

You may set a label to customize the text that should be displayed in the button for adding a repeater item:

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->addButtonLabel('Add member')
```

## Disabling functionality

You may also prevent the user from adding items, deleting items, or moving items inside the repeater:

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->addable(false)
    ->deletable(false)
    ->reorderable(false)
```

## Validation

You may customize the number of items that may be created, using the `minItems()` and `maxItems()` methods:

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->minItems(1)
    ->maxItems(10)
```

## Collapsible

The repeater may be `collapsible()` to optionally hide content in long forms:

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible()
```

You may collapse all items by default:

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsed()
```

## Cloning items

You may allow repeater items to be duplicated using the `cloneable()` method:

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->cloneable()
```

## Populating automatically from a relationship

You may employ the `relationship()` method of the repeater to configure a relationship to automatically retrieve and save repeater items:

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

> To set this functionality up, **you must also follow the instructions set out in the [field relationships](getting-started#field-relationships) section**. If you're using the [app framework](../../app), you can skip this step.

### Ordering items

By default, ordering relationship repeater items is disabled. This is because your related model needs an `sort` column to store the order of related records. To enable ordering, you may use the `orderable()` method:

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->orderable()
```

This assumes that your related model has a `sort` column.

If you use something like [`spatie/eloquent-sortable`](https://github.com/spatie/eloquent-sortable) with an order column such as `order_column`, you may pass this in to `orderable()`:

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->orderable('order_column')
```

## Grid layout

You may organize repeater items into columns by using the `grid()` method:

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->grid(2)
```

This method accepts the same options as the `columns()` method of the [grid](layout/grid). This allows you to responsively customize the number of grid columns at various breakpoints.

## Item labels

You may add a label for repeater items using the `itemLabel()` method:

```php
use Cable\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Cable\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')
            ->lazy(),
    ])
    ->itemLabel(fn (array $state): ?string => $state['name'] ?? null),
```

Any fields that you use from `$state` should be `reactive()` or `lazy()` if you wish to see the item label update live as you use the form.

## Using `$get()` to access parent field values

All form components are able to [use `$get()` and `$set()`](advanced) to access another field's value. However, you might experience unexpected behaviour when using this inside the repeater's schema.

This is because `$get()` and `$set()`, by default, are scoped to the current repeater item. This means that you are able to interact with another field inside that repeater item easily without knowing which repeater item the current form component belongs to.

The consequence of this, is that you may be confused when you are unable to interact with a field outside the repeater. We use `../` syntax to solve this problem - `$get('../../parent_field_name')`.

Consider your form has this data structure:

```php
[
    'client_id' => 1,

    'repeater' => [
        'item1' => [
            'service_id' => 2,
        ],
    ],
]
```

You are trying to retrieve the value of `client_id` from inside the repeater item.

`$get()` is relative to the current repeater item, so `$get('client_id')` is looking for `$get('repeater.item1.client_id')`.

You can use `../` to go up a level in the data structure, so `$get('../client_id')` is $get('repeater.client_id') and `$get('../../client_id')` is `$get('client_id')`.
