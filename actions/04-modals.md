Actions may require additional confirmation or input from the user before they run. You may open a modal before an action is executed to do this.

## Confirmation modals

You may require confirmation before an action is run using the `requiresConfirmation()` method. This is useful for particularly destructive actions, such as those that delete records.

```php
Action::make('delete')
    ->action(fn () => $this->record->delete())
    ->requiresConfirmation()
```

> Note: The confirmation modal is not available when a `url()` is set instead of an `action()`. Instead, you should redirect to the URL within the `action()` callback.

## Setting a modal heading, subheading, and button label

You may customize the heading, subheading and button label of the modal:

```php
Action::make('delete')
    ->action(fn () => $this->record->delete())
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->modalHeading('Delete post')
    ->modalSubheading('Are you sure you\'d like to delete this post? This cannot be undone.')
    ->modalButton('Yes, delete it')
```

## Modal forms

You may also render a form in the modal to collect extra information from the user before the action runs.

You may use components from the [Form Builder](../forms) to create custom action modal forms. The data from the form is available in the `$data` array of the `action()` callback:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Cable\Forms\Components\Select;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->form([
        Select::make('authorId')
            ->label('Author')
            ->options(User::query()->pluck('name', 'id'))
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        $this->record->author()->associate($data['authorId']);
        $this->record->save();
    })
```

### Filling the form with existing data

You may fill the form with existing data, using the `fillForm()` method:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Cable\Forms\Components\Select;
use Cable\Forms\Form;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->fillForm([
        'authorId' => $this->record->author->id,
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        $this->record->author()->associate($data['authorId']);
        $this->record->save();
    })
    ->form([
        Select::make('authorId')
            ->label('Author')
            ->options(User::query()->pluck('name', 'id'))
            ->required(),
    ])
```

## Custom modal content

You may define custom content to be rendered inside your modal, which you can specify by passing a Blade view into the `modalContent()` method:

```php
Action::make('advance')
    ->action(fn () => $this->record->advance())
    ->modalContent(view('cable.pages.actions.advance'))
```

By default, the custom content is displayed above the modal form if there is one, but you can add content below using `modalFooter()` if you wish:

```php
Action::make('advance')
    ->action(fn () => $this->record->advance())
    ->modalFooter(view('cable.pages.actions.advance'))
```

## Using a slide-over instead of a modal

You can open a "slide-over" dialog instead of a modal by using the `slideOver()` method:

```php
Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->form([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->slideOver()
```

Instead of opening in the center of the screen, the modal content will now slide in from the right and consume the entire height of the browser.

## Changing the modal width

You can change the width of the modal by using the `modalWidth()` method. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`, `3xl`, `4xl`, `5xl`, `6xl`, `7xl`, and `screen`:

```php
Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->form([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->modalWidth('5xl')
```

## Conditionally hiding the modal

You may have a need to conditionally show a modal for confirmation reasons while falling back to the default action. This can be achieved using `modalHidden()`:

```php
Action::make('create')
    ->action('create')
    ->modalHidden(fn (): bool => $this->role !== 'admin')
    ->modalContent(view('cable.pages.actions.create'))
```
