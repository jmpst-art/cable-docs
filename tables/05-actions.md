title: Actions

Cable's tables can use [actions](../actions). They are buttons that can be added to the [end of any table row](#row-actions), or even in the [header](#header-actions) of a table. For instance, you may want an action to "create" a new record in the header, and then "edit" and "delete" actions on each row. [Bulk actions](#bulk-actions) can be used to execute code when records in the table are selected. Additionally, actions can be added to any [table column](#column-actions), such that each cell in that column is a trigger for your action.

It's highly advised that you read the documentation about [customizing action trigger buttons](../actions/trigger-button) and [action modals](../actions/modals) to that you are aware of the full capabilities of actions.

## Row actions

Action buttons can be rendered at the end of each table row. You can put them in the `$table->actions()` method:

```php
use Cable\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->actions([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Actions may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its name. The name of the action should be unique.

You can then pass a callback to `action()` which executes the task, or a callback to `url()` which generates a link URL:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Cable\Tables\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => route('posts.edit', $record))
    ->openUrlInNewTab()

Action::make('delete')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->delete())
```

All methods on the action accept callback functions, where you can access the current table `$record` that was clicked.

### Row actions position

By default, the row actions in your table are rendered in the final cell. You may change the position by using the `position` argument:

```php
use Cable\Tables\Actions\Position;
use Cable\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->actions([
            // ...
        ], position: Position::BeforeColumns);
}
```

## Bulk actions

Tables also support "bulk actions". These can be used when the user selects rows int the table. Traditionally, when rows are selected, a "bulk actions" button appears in the top left corner of the table. When the user clicks this button, they are presented with a dropdown menu of actions to choose from. You can put them in the `$table->bulkActions()` method:

```php
use Cable\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->bulkActions([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Bulk actions may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its name. The name of the action should be unique. You should then pass a callback to `action()` which executes the task:

```php
use Cable\Tables\Actions\BulkAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

BulkAction::make('delete')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete())
```

All methods on the bulk action accept callback functions, where you can access the current table `$records` that are selected. It is an Eloquent collection of models.

### Deselecting records once a bulk action has finished

You may deselect the records after a bulk action has been executed using the `deselectRecordsAfterCompletion()` method:

```php
use Cable\Tables\Actions\BulkAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

BulkAction::make('delete')
    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete())
    ->deselectRecordsAfterCompletion()
```

### Disabling record bulk actions

You may conditionally disable bulk actions for a specific record:

```php
use Cable\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->bulkActions([
            // ...
        ])
        ->checkIfRecordIsSelectableUsing(
            fn (Model $record): bool => $record->status === Status::Enabled,
        );
}
```

## Header actions

Both [row actions](#row-actions) and [bulk actions](#bulk-actions) can be rendered in the header of the table. You can put them in the `$table->headerActions()` method:

```php
use Cable\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->headerActions([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

This is useful for things like "create" actions, which are not related to any specific table row, or bulk actions that need to be more visible.

## Column actions

Actions can be added to columns, such that when a cell in that column is clicked, it acts as the trigger for an action. You can learn more about [column actions](columns/getting-started#running-actions) in the documentation.

## Prebuilt table actions

Cable includes several prebuilt actions and bulk actions that you can add to a table. Their aim is to simplify the most common Eloquent-related actions:

- [Create](../actions/prebuilt-actions/create)
- [Edit](../actions/prebuilt-actions/edit)
- [View](../actions/prebuilt-actions/view)
- [Delete](../actions/prebuilt-actions/delete)
- [Replicate](../actions/prebuilt-actions/replicate)
- [Force-delete](../actions/prebuilt-actions/force-delete)
- [Restore](../actions/prebuilt-actions/restore)

## Grouping actions

You may use an `ActionGroup` object to group multiple table actions together in a dropdown:

```php
use Cable\Tables\Actions\ActionGroup;
use Cable\Tables\Actions\DeleteAction;
use Cable\Tables\Actions\EditAction;
use Cable\Tables\Actions\ViewAction;
use Cable\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->actions([
            ActionGroup::make([
                ViewAction::make(),
                EditAction::make(),
                DeleteAction::make(),
            ]),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```
