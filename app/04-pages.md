Cable allows you to create completely custom pages for the app.

## Creating a page

To create a new page, you can use:

```bash
php artisan make:cable-page Settings
```

This command will create two files - a page class in the `/Pages` directory of the Cable directory, and a view in the `/pages` directory of the Cable views directory.

Page classes are all full-page [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com) components with a few extra utilities you can use with the app framework.

## Conditionally hiding pages in navigation

You can prevent pages from appearing in the menu by overriding the `shouldRegisterNavigation()` method in your Page class. This is useful if you want to control which users can see the page in the sidebar.

```php
public static function shouldRegisterNavigation(): bool
{
    return auth()->user()->canManageSettings();
}
```

Please be aware that all users will still be able to visit this page through its direct URL, so to fully limit access you must also also check in the `mount()` method of the page:

```php
public function mount(): void
{
    abort_unless(auth()->user()->canManageSettings(), 403);
}
```

## Actions

Actions are buttons that can perform tasks on the page, or visit a URL. You can read more about their capabilities [here](../actions).

Since all pages are Livewire components, you can [add actions](../actions/adding-an-action-to-a-livewire-component#adding-the-action) anywhere. Pages already have the `InteractsWithActions` trait, `HasActions` interface, and `<x-cable-actions::modals />` Blade component all set up for you.

### Header actions

You can also easily add actions to the header of any page, including [resource pages](resources). You don't need to worry about adding anything to the Blade, we handle that for you. Just return your actions from the `getHeaderActions()` method of the page class:

```php
use Cable\Actions\Action;

protected function getHeaderActions(): array
{
    return [
        Action::make('edit')
            ->url(route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post])),
        Action::make('delete')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(fn () => $this->post->delete()),
    ];
}
```

### Refreshing form data

If you're using actions on an [Edit](resources/editing-records) or [View](resources/viewing-records) resource page, you can refresh data within the main form using the `refreshFormData()` method:

```php
use Cable\Actions\Action;

Action::make('approve')
    ->action(function () {
        $this->record->approve();

        $this->refreshFormData([
            'status',
        ]);
    })
```

This method accepts an array of model attributes that you wish to refresh in the form.

## Widgets

Cable allows you to display [widgets](dashboard) inside pages, below the header and above the footer.

To add a widget to a page, use the `getHeaderWidgets()` or `getFooterWidgets()` methods:

```php
use App/Cable/Widgets/StatsOverviewWidget;

protected function getHeaderWidgets(): array
{
    return [
        StatsOverviewWidget::class
    ];
}
```

`getHeaderWidgets()` returns an array of widgets to display above the page content, whereas `getFooterWidgets()` are displayed below.

If you'd like to learn how to build and customize widgets, check out the [Dashboard](dashboard) documentation section.

### Customizing the widgets grid

You may change how many grid columns are used to display widgets.

You may override the `getHeaderWidgetsColumns()` or `getFooterWidgetsColumns()` methods to return a number of grid columns to use:

```php
protected function getHeaderWidgetsColumns(): int | array
{
    return 3;
}
```

#### Responsive widgets grid

You may wish to change the number of widget grid columns based on the responsive [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) of the browser. You can do this using an array that contains the number of columns that should be used at each breakpoint:

```php
protected function getHeaderWidgetsColumns(): int | array
{
    return [
        'md' => 4,
        'xl' => 5,
    ];
}
```

This pairs well with [responsive widget widths](dashboard#responsive-widget-widths).


## Customization

Cable will automatically generate a title, navigation label and URL (slug) for your page based on its name. You may override it using static properties of your page class:

```php
protected static ?string $title = 'Custom Page Title';

protected static ?string $navigationLabel = 'Custom Navigation Label';

protected static ?string $slug = 'custom-url-slug';
```

You may also specify a custom header and footer view for any page. You may return them from the `getHeader()` and `getFooter()` methods:

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;

protected function getHeader(): View
{
    return view('cable.settings.custom-header');
}

protected function getFooter(): View
{
    return view('cable.settings.custom-footer');
}
```
