title: Global search
---

Global search allows you to search across all of your resource records, from anywhere in the app.

## Title

To enable global search on your model, you must [set a title attribute](#setting-a-title-attribute) for your resource:

```php
protected static ?string $recordTitleAttribute = 'title';
```

This attribute is used to retrieve the search result title for that record.

You may customize the title further by overriding `getGlobalSearchResultTitle()` method:

```php
public static function getGlobalSearchResultTitle(Model $record): string
{
    return $record->name;
}
```

## Multi-column search

If you would like to search across multiple columns of your resource, you may override the `getGloballySearchableAttributes()` method. "Dot notation" allows you to search inside of relationships:

```php
public static function getGloballySearchableAttributes(): array
{
    return ['title', 'slug', 'author.name', 'category.name'];
}
```

## Details

Search results can display "details" below their title, which gives the user more information about the record. To enable this feature, you must override the `getGlobalSearchResultDetails()` method:

```php
public static function getGlobalSearchResultDetails(Model $record): array
{
    return [
        'Author' => $record->author->name,
        'Category' => $record->category->name,
    ];
}
```

In this example, the category and author of the record will be displayed below its title in the search result. However, the `category` and `author` relationships will be lazy-loaded, which will result in poor results performance. To [eager-load](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#eager-loading) these relationships, we must override the `getGlobalSearchEloquentQuery()` method:

```php
public static function getGlobalSearchEloquentQuery(): Builder
{
    return parent::getGlobalSearchEloquentQuery()->with(['author', 'category']);
}
```

## URL

Global search results will link to the [Edit page](editing-records) of your resource, or the [View page](viewing-page) if the user does not have [edit permissions](editing-records#authorization). To customize this, you may override the `getGlobalSearchResultUrl()` method and return a route of your choice:

```php
public static function getGlobalSearchResultUrl(Model $record): string
{
    return UserResource::getUrl('edit', ['record' => $record]);
}
```

## Actions

Global search supports actions, which are buttons that render below each search result. They can open a URL or emit a Livewire event. 

Actions can be defined as follows:

```php
use Cable\GlobalSearch\Actions\Action;

public static function getGlobalSearchResultActions(Model $record): array
{
    return [
        Action::make('edit')
            ->url(static::getUrl('edit', ['record' => $record])),
    ];
}
```

You can learn more about how to style action buttons [here](../../actions/trigger-button).

### Opening URLs from actions

You can open a URL, optionally in a new tab, when clicking on an action:

```php
use Cable\GlobalSearch\Actions\Action;

Action::make('view')
    ->url(static::getUrl('view', ['record' => $record]), shouldOpenInNewTab: true)
```

### Emitting Livewire events from actions

Sometimes you want to execute additional code when a global search result action is clicked. This can be achieved by setting a Livewire event which should be emitted on clicking the action. You may optionally pass an array of data, which will be available as parameters in the event listener on your Livewire component:

```php
use Cable\GlobalSearch\Actions\Action;

Action::make('quickView')
    ->emit('quickView', [$record->id])
```
